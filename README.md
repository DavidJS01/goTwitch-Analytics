## Go-Twitch Analytics
Go-Twitch is a self-service, containerized solution to aggregating and visualizing Twitch chat data in near-real time.

Go-Twitch is a rewrite of my first data engineering Python project, but written in Go (with more elaborate technology).

This is in effort to continously learn and exit my comfort zones to become a great data engineer.

## Disclaimers and Notes
This project is continously being updated and developed, with UI/front-end capability being prioritized.

Due to budget constraints, this project is locally containerized. In the ideal world, it would be hosted on AWS and be a public facing website.

Top priority development goals:
1. MVP front-end UI for a user-friendly experience 
2. Unit testing
3. Github Actions CI/CD pipeline
